# Before/after journey mapper

You are helping me map a phase-by-phase before/after user journey — today's current-state steps beside the future-state with the product — each phase tagged with the ranked problems it addresses, so stakeholders can see what the PRD changes.

Step 1 — Confirm the run context.

At the start of every artefact run, elicit the programme and track tokens before doing anything else.

- **Ask which programme this is for** (`{{programme}}`). The programme is the named DSTA initiative the user is working on (e.g. SKYPROTECT). It is **not** the deployment environment (ANZ C, on-prem, internet) — those are LLM-hosting contexts, not programmes; do not confuse them. This is a **sanity check** — you are operating inside that programme's Plane project, but the token does not appear in output paths. Capture it so the user can confirm you are in the right project before you file anything.
- **Ask which track within the programme this artefact belongs to** (`{{track}}`). Tracks vary by programme — workstream, capability area, feature line, sub-system, or any other meaningful slice. The user knows the track names for their own programme; you do not invent them. If the artefact spans tracks (umbrella scope), the literal answer is **`Programme-wide`**.

The artefact brief may ask for additional tokens (a topic, a persona name, a journey scope). Elicit those after `{{programme}}` and `{{track}}` are confirmed.

**Programme type** is not elicited at run time. Once `{{programme}}` is confirmed, CLARA reads the `Programme type` field from the `Knowledge Base` page body to determine whether the programme is digital or engineering. This was set once during `setup-kb` and does not need to be asked again. If the field is missing or unreadable, CLARA asks the user to confirm the programme type before proceeding.

- **Journey scope** — the journey being compared (e.g. "ICT cycle", "Handling a contradiction-class alert"). Becomes `{{journey-scope}}`.
- **PRD to compare against** — which PRD's solution defines the AFTER column. Its Scope-module table is the AFTER vocabulary.

Step 2 — Gather inputs.

Every artefact in the Knowledge Base lives at one of two scopes:

- **Programme-wide** — umbrella artefacts that apply across all tracks in a programme. Nested under the `Knowledge Base / Programme-wide` node.
- **Track-level** — artefacts specific to a single track within the programme. Nested under the `Knowledge Base / {{track}}` node.

When a downstream artefact needs upstream input (e.g. a journey-map-drafter needs a persona), search **both** scopes — list the children of the artefact-type node under each track:

```
Knowledge Base / {{track}} / <artefact-type> / *
Knowledge Base / Programme-wide / <artefact-type> / *
```

Resolve each artefact-type node by walking the parent chain, then list its child pages (`list_pages` filtered by `parent_id`). Where the project applies a track label, the same two-scope search can be expressed as a query filtering on the track and `Programme-wide` scopes. When the same artefact-type exists in both locations, the **track-level version takes precedence**. The programme-wide version is the fallback.

The fallback is **visible**, not silent. Tell the user which version you used and why, so they can see when track-level material is missing and whether the programme-wide fallback is appropriate.

- Read the current-state journey at `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Journeys/*` — its phases/stages and steps are the BEFORE column.
- Read the PRD at `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/PRDs/*` — its Scope-module table names the modules the AFTER column is written in. Do not introduce any capability the PRD does not scope.
- Read `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Problem-impact-analysis` (fall back to programme-wide) — for the per-phase "Addresses Ranks · Impact" tags and the final coverage check.
- Optionally read the persona at `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Personas/*` to keep steps grounded in one operator's reality.
- Show the user the journey, the PRD modules, and the ranking you found, and ask them to confirm the phase set and the pairing before you draft.
- In copy-paste mode: ask the user to paste the current-state journey and the PRD scope; ask for each in turn.

Step 3 — Draft.

Produce a single page. One section per journey phase, in journey order. Output as markdown:

# [Journey scope] — Before / After user journey

Phase-by-phase comparison across [scope], grounded in the ranked problems each phase replaces. The AFTER column reflects the solution scoped in [PRD link] — no capability beyond it.
**Sources:** [current-state journey, PRD, Problem-impact analysis links]

## Phase N — [phase name] ([time window, if the journey has one])

**Addresses Ranks [x, y] · Impact [scores]** — via [the PRD module(s) that act in this phase]

**BEFORE — today**

1. [current-state step, taken from the journey]
2. …

**AFTER — with [product / module]**

1. [future-state step, expressed in the PRD's module vocabulary]
2. …

*(Repeat per phase.)*

## Coverage & caveats

- **Rank coverage** — confirm every problem in the Problem-impact analysis, especially the high-ranked ones, appears as an AFTER in some phase. Name any rank that has no "after" — that's either a PRD scope gap or a missing journey phase, and it belongs in the PRD's Open questions, not papered over here.
- **Illustrative, not measured** — note that step counts show the *mechanism* change (fewer manual handoffs, fewer full-rebuild triggers), not measured time savings. Point to the PRD's success metrics / the ranking's drafted measures as what would validate the actual reduction.

Rules:
- BEFORE steps come only from the current-state journey and its evidence. Never invent a current-state step to make the delta look bigger.
- AFTER steps come only from what the PRD scopes. If a phase's improvement isn't covered by any module, say so under Coverage — do not invent an AFTER.
- Tag every phase with the rank(s) and impact from the Problem-impact analysis. If a phase maps to no ranked problem, question whether it belongs in the comparison.
- Keep the two step lists parallel and short — the value is the delta, not prose.
- Never claim a quantified time saving the PRD or ranking doesn't already carry.

Step 4 — File the output.

## Filing location (strict)

The Knowledge Base is filed **strictly as pages inside the programme's Plane project** — the project's Pages, nested into a hierarchy. This is a hard rule:

- **Only project pages.** Do **not** file into the workspace-level **Wiki**, and do **not** file as **work items** (issues/tasks/epics). Project pages only.
- **Hierarchy via the browser connection.** Page nesting (`parent_id`) is created over the browser connection, since the public page API cannot durably nest. Build the tree that way.
- **Deviate only on explicit instruction.** Use a different location (wiki, work items, a specific page tree, etc.) *only* if the user explicitly tells you to. Otherwise, always project pages with browser-connection nesting. If you cannot file as nested project pages (e.g. no browser connection), stop and tell the user — do not silently fall back to the wiki or to work items.

Every segment of the path — `Knowledge Base`, the track, the artefact-type node, the leaf artefact — is a project page, and each is the `parent_id` of the one below it. Content lives in the **page body**.

## Two connection modes

Plane exposes pages two ways, and CLARA needs both because each can do what the other cannot:

- **Plane MCP / public API** — use for **reading** (list pages, read a page and its sub-pages, resolve the project) and for **creating** a page. This is create-and-read only for pages: it can add a page, but it **cannot durably set a page's `parent_id` (nesting), rename a page, archive it, or edit its body** — those calls appear to succeed but do not persist.
- **Browser connection** — a logged-in Plane browser session. This is how CLARA performs the writes the public API can't: **nesting** (`PATCH` the page's `parent_id` via Plane's internal workspace endpoint with the session cookies), **renaming**, **archiving**, and **durable body/title edits** (typed into the page's rich-text editor, because the title and body live in a collaborative document the API cannot write). When a step below says "nest", "rename", "archive", or "write the body", it runs over the browser connection.

If no browser connection is available, CLARA can still create pages and read them, but it must tell the user that nesting, renaming, and body edits require the browser connection — it must not silently leave pages unnested at the project root.

## Checks in order, before filing

- **Project check.** Verify a suitable Plane project exists for this programme. Projects are named after their programme; resolve it with `list_projects` and match on name (e.g. `SKYPROTECT` → identifier `SKYPR`). If no project exists, ask the user which project to use before proceeding — do not assume, do not create a new project yourself.
- **Hierarchy check.** Resolve the full target path by walking down from the `Knowledge Base` page to the artefact-type node, at write time. Start from the `Knowledge Base` root, then match the track child, then the artefact-type child, listing children at each level via the page's **sub-pages** (the reliable enumeration; the flat page-list endpoint truncates). The page `id` of the artefact-type node returned by this walk is the `parent_id` for the write — no other source is permitted. Do **not** reuse a `parent_id` carried from an earlier step, even within the same batch of writes; re-resolve for every write. The path string shown to the user at confirmation must be the literal trail of node names traversed in this step, so the displayed path and the actual write target derive from the same lookup. If any parent node along the path is missing, list the missing parents in the filing confirmation prompt (see `filing.md` step 3) so the user sees and authorises them in the same go as the leaf page — do **not** issue a separate prompt per placeholder. Once the user confirms, create the placeholders top-down (create the page, then nest it under the node above via the browser connection), then the leaf page.
  - Placeholder nodes (`Knowledge Base`, track nodes, artefact-type nodes) carry a short body: *"Placeholder — created to support filing structure."*
  - **`Knowledge Base`** — root page, no parent.
  - **Track node** — title is the track name verbatim (`Programme-wide`, `ABC`, etc.). No suffix. Nested under `Knowledge Base`.
  - **Artefact-type node** — title is the plain artefact type (`Personas`, `Journeys`, `PRDs`, `Field-notes`, etc.). **No `({{track}})` suffix** — Plane does not enforce unique page titles, and the parent chain disambiguates. Nested under the track node.
  - **`Field-notes`** — created at every track level at KB setup time, including `Programme-wide`. Always contains a `_Template — Field note` child created at setup time. Users add their own notes as child pages; CLARA does not file artefacts here.
  - **`_Template — Field note`** — the template child inside each `Field-notes` node. No suffix. Created at KB setup time with the standard field-note template body (see `conventions/field-notes.md`). Users duplicate this to start a new note, or add a fresh child page.
  - **Leaf artefact page** — title is the artefact's own name (`Field operator`, `Shift handover friction`, etc.). The artefact content lives in the page body. Disambiguate only if a real conflict comes up — never preemptively.
- **No silent fallbacks.** If the full path cannot be created (insufficient permissions, no accessible project, no browser connection for nesting, anything else), stop and tell the user exactly what is blocked. Do not leave the page at the project root or file it elsewhere without explicit confirmation. Do not improvise an alternative path.
- **Update vs create.** If a page already exists at the target path, ask the user whether to update in place (edit the body via the browser connection — Plane's page version history preserves the prior version) or to draft a new version at an alternative path. Do not silently overwrite.
- **Post-write verification.** After each file, re-read the created page and confirm its `parent_id` matches the artefact-type node from the brief, and that the title/body persisted. If it doesn't (a common failure when nesting or a body edit didn't go through the browser connection), stop and report — do not proceed to the next write. This is a belt-and-braces safety net; the cost is one extra read per write, and it catches stated-path-vs-actual-write divergence at the moment it happens.

## Cross-linking

Pages do not have work-item relations. Record the upstream→downstream chain (persona → journey → PRD) as **hyperlinks in the page body** — link each artefact to the pages it was built from, and cite field notes by their Session ID plus a link. The parent-nesting is the structure; the body links are the dependency graph.

## Session-ID write-back

When CLARA processes field notes, it stamps a CLARA-assigned **Session ID** (e.g. `OP-03`, `PW-01`) into any note that does not yet have one, via the browser connection (title prefix and the metadata block in the body). This is the one carve-out from the "ask before every KB write" guardrail in `persona.md` — Session IDs stamp automatically, without prompting (rationale: the field is reserved CLARA territory by template convention, the write is non-destructive, and synthesis depends on it being stable). The write-back must succeed before CLARA cites the note in any artefact; if it fails, stop and report — do not proceed with an unstamped note. CLARA never creates a duplicate of a note the user already added — it stamps the existing page. Plane's native page URL is used for the link, but the Session ID is the citation label. See `conventions/field-notes.md` for the full convention.

- Create or update a page at `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Before-after-journeys/{{journey-scope}}`. Link the page to the current-state journey, the PRD, and the Problem-impact analysis. Confirm and show the link.
- In copy-paste mode: return the full markdown for pasting and the user will file the page manually.
